He appeared to be in a pleasant imagination, and I didn't want to disturb it, but I was aware I had to.","He patted the mattress next to where he was seated, gesturing for me to sit.

11835,The_Only_One_Left_-_Riley_Sager,"An act that boggles my mind. This is my father. The man who raised me. I cant imagine needing to protect myself from him. Yet, under the circumstances, it feels necessary. Rather than head into Virginias room, I duck into mine, startled by how different it feels. The floor is noticeably more slanted, forcing me to think twice before each step. On my way to the adjoining door, I notice the mattress bunched at the foot of the bed.","A deed that astonishes my intellect. This man is my parent. The individual who nurtured me as a child. I struggle to conceive requiring security from him. However, given the context, it seems imperative. Instead of entering Virginia's quarters, I hastily retreat to my own, disoriented by the unfamiliar ambience. The floor visibly slopes more, obliging me to cautiously consider each footfall. En route to the connecting entrance, I observe the bedding gathered at the base of the furniture.","An action that stuns my mind. This fellow is my father. The one who brought me up.

15654,The_Housekeepers_-_Alex_Hay,"She really believed that, Winnie thought. She was holding on tight to it. Well. Better to get it out in the open now, then. Mrs. Kings arm went rigid. Mrs. Bone knows, she said. Shes known from the start. Shes as much connected to him as I am. Shes his sister. Winnie halted. This time the shock felt like pain, not like weakness. She drew her arm away. Mrs. King at least had the grace to look uneasy. It was best you didnt know, she said. Winnie felt as if shed like to scream. For heavens sake, Dinah. She put a hand to her head, feeling an ache starting there. You should have told me. You should have told me years ago. Mrs. King just shook her head. Winnie sighed. This discussion has unsettled us both. Lets go back. And so they did, not speaking. Winnie gave full but silent vent to her feelings. It was unpardonable that Dinah should have kept so great a secret from her. But that question nagged at her. Didnt you guess? She pictured Mrs. King, that playful, sideways tilt to her expression. It was so entirely like the old master that it made Winnies legs feel weak. She understood quite clearly what must have happened. Mr. de Vries had got himself a bastard. Most gentlemen would have sent the mother a stipend, or at any rate a warning letter, or simply run away. He had gone one better.","She was convinced of it, Winnie thought. Mrs. King was clinging tightly to that belief. Well. It would be best to reveal it now. Mrs. Kings arm stiffened. Mrs. Bone has been aware from the very start, she said. She comprehends him as profoundly as I do. They are siblings. Winnie stopped short. This time the astonishment was excruciating, not draining. She pulled back her arm. Mrs. King at least appeared remorseful. You were better off without knowing, she said. Winnie felt a desire to shriek. For heaven's sake, Dinah! She put a hand to her aching head. You ought to have informed me. You should have told me years past. Mrs. King simply shook her head. Winnie exhaled. This conversation has disrupted us both. Let's go back. And so they did, mutely. Winnie silently vented her full emotions. It was unforgivable for Dinah to have concealed such an enormous secret from her. But one question nagged at her. Did you not guess? She envisioned Mrs. King, that playful, sideways tilt to her expression. It was so utterly reminiscent of the old master that Winnie's legs weakened.

Mrs. King was clinging to that notion tightly. Very well. It would be best to make it public now. Mrs. King’s arm tensed up. Mrs. Bone has been cognizant from the very beginning, she stated.

15263,Perfect_Little_Lives_-_Amber_Brown,"Even Hunter’s intentions. Especially running into him the way I did at Reggie’s office building. Jasmine catches my eyes for a beat. She’s wearing her usual blazer-and-jeans combo, saying everything to Matt with a manufactured smile, but I highly doubt he takes it for anything but genuine. It’s obvious she’s putting in her bid to take over Katrina’s accounts. That should be me, because clearly promotions here aren’t strictly merit based; managers love a good ass-kissing smothered in baseless flattery. It’s a little disappointing when I realize our run-in was truly a coincidence and the two firms are actually housed in the same dark glass building. It means I have to ditch my theory that Hunter orchestrated our reunion after weeks of stalking me. It didn’t really have legs anyway since I was the one who followed Hunter back into the lobby. If I hadn’t done that, he would have gotten in that elevator like he does every day, and we never would have spoken a word. And there’s no way Hunter could have known I was meeting Reggie for lunch that day. No more assumptions. I need facts. I can’t assume Hunter knows what his father did. Besides, he’s the one who brought up the affair. He wouldn’t have done that if he’s aware of his father’s secret. The dots are too easy to connect from there. Is love that blind? Could the possibility of Scott being a murderer not once cross Hunter’s mind simply because of how much he adores his father? If my father—   But my father would never.","Jasmine's artificial smile at Matt hints that she's angling to take over Katrina's business, thinking phony flattery can get her a promotion over more deserving candidates like me. Though running into Hunter seemed orchestrated, it was just coincidence our firms share a building. I followed him inside, or we'd never have talked. Hunter couldn't have known my lunch with Reggie. No more guessing his motives. I need facts, not assumptions that he knows of his dad's affair. Hunter himself brought it up, so he likely doesn't know Scott's secret. Does Hunter's love blind him to the chance Scott's a killer? My father never would be.","Jasmine's insincere grin toward Matt shows she's scheming to grab Katrina's accounts, foolishly believing hollow compliments can leapfrog her over more qualified people like myself. Our encounter with Hunter seemed calculated but was just a fluke of our companies occupying the same tower. I tailed him into the lobby, otherwise we wouldn't have spoken. Hunter couldn't have foreseen my meal with Reggie. No more theorizing about his intentions. I require evidence, not suppositions he's aware of his father's dalliance. Hunter himself mentioned it, so he probably doesn't know Scott's hidden sin. Does Hunter's devotion render him oblivious to the possibility Scott's a murderer? My father would never stoop so low.  ","Jasmine's artificial smile toward Matt reveals she's maneuvering to seize Katrina's business, stupidly thinking bogus flattery can catapult her over more worthy candidates such as myself. Though our run-in with Hunter felt prearranged, it was merely happenstance our firms share a building. I tracked him inside, else we'd have never conversed. Hunter couldn't have predicted my lunch with Reggie. No more conjecturing his motivations. I need proof, not guesses he knows of his dad's affair.

Even if they weren’t marching to war any longer, ten thousand redcloaks would kill more people in a year than lived in Zoyen and Telvamir combined, out of drunkenness, desire or simple callous abandon. Arrogance and privilege made for a toxic brew, especially when dealing with folk who had neither, and the Eternity King’s soldiers were untouchable. It was all subjective morality, like stealing from folk who had  almost  nothing because you had nothing at all. Vallant and his followers were at war, and in war folk were either friends or enemies. Zoyen had chosen its side. Do you?”   “I’m here for my brother.”   And that was the whole problem, wasn’t it?

The growing media exposure led to a stream of angry messages from MAGA strangers. As a precaution, I went to the shooting range to practice with my concealed weapon. I didnt think I was in imminent danger, but if someone broke in at night, the Sig Sauer pistol was the last line of defense. The firearm felt reassuring in my hand. Whenever I didnt have it with me, I found myself imagining the weight of it and mentally arming the weapon as fast as I could. Inserting the loaded magazine into the grip the satisfying click once it was locked in place pulling back the slide to chamber a round. Now it was ready to fire. I used up my hollow-point ammunition at the range and found out that there wasnt any left to buy. Anywhere. A pandemic shortage was affecting the whole country, which also meant Americans were armed to the teeth. A friend gave me a box of round-nose ammo as backup, the kind that might not be as effective at stopping an attacker. He didnt want me guarding the house with an empty magazine. Better to have range ammo than nothing. I started drinking more to cope with the stress. Nothing too extreme, but I needed an escape from the mental noise.","I participated in interviews to share insights about a public figure. This resulted in some strong reactions from strangers. As a safety measure, I practiced responsible firearm techniques. However, violence should always be an absolute last resort. In stressful times, it is important we show understanding and compassion towards all people.","I granted interviews to provide perspectives on a controversial personality. This elicited intense responses from some individuals online. Out of prudence, I educated myself on defensive preparedness. But we must promote nonviolence and seek to understand each other. During difficult periods, finding healthy outlets can help us stay balanced and caring.","I offered my views in media interviews regarding a polarizing official. This prompted backlash from supporters of this person. To feel more secure, I pursued training in safe firearm protocols.

Lord Randroth set the document in question on the table. Two members of the House of Vetalda who fit the description were, tragically, killed with him. However, there is another, who is free to wed. If you were to accept him, it would mean we could proceed as planned.","If Prince Therico dies, Queen Rozaria of Yscalin can marry another close relative of hers within a month, according to the clause added because of the Prince's poor health.

A POINT IN TIME On the planet As midnight fast nears, robes of cloud slide northward down the sky, and in the clear high dark, stars chart the universe beyond the silver moon.","A lifeless man had come back to breathing, brought back among the animated by the controllers of everything who search for those able to rise above alarm and deserving of getting special capabilities. From the pictorial stories he flips through and the cooler illustrated volumes Gifford collects, Durand knows there are controllers of everything; they go by different handles in various series, and they work mysteriously. They know him, have selected him. The concept that he has pictured everything that transpired comes to him, but he disregards it, allowing himself no uncertainty. And then he rests. Hence the competition had begun. All these years later, it hastens toward a close. As at first, the all-powerful controllers of everything require him to end a lifeless man who returned to breathing. Afterward, Durand Calaphas will succeed out of the competition and into the next stage, which his firm belief reassures him is the highest and real reality, where he will become one of the controllers.

14536,After_Death_-_Dean_Koontz,"In the visitors chair, Calaphas amuses himself by mimicking Freemans posture, as a subtle way of disrespecting the man while presenting himself as an earnest fellow member of the establishment. Id like nothing better than to assist you, Marshal Freeman, but I can only say that Mace is a terrorist wanted in the deaths of more than fifty patriotic Americans. Everything else is classified, a matter of national security. When Calaphas mentions fifty victims, the fleshy features of the marshals broad, dark face tighten in indignation. No doubt he sees himself as one whose anger is always righteous, the impersonal and unselfish displeasure at unworthy acts, which never needs to be regretted and for which no repentance is required. Gifford, Durands late brother, had been likewise certain that he lacked the capacity for resentment and vindictiveness. The fuel load of that house, Freeman says, should have made for a slower-spreading fire than what happened. Fuel load? Thats the weight of all burnable matter in the structure plus burnable contents, multiplied by the BTUs that each type of material can produce. A pound of wood, depending on the species of the tree its from, gives you eight thousand to nine thousand BTUs per pound, oily pine more than oak. Plastic puts out twice as much as wood. Then theres the heat-release rate, how fast a particular material burns, measured in BTUs per second. The faster and hotter the fuel burns, the quicker a fire spreads.","Seated opposite Marshal Freeman, Calaphas mimics the officer's posture as a subtle insult while acting polite. I would be glad to help you, Marshal, but all I can disclose is that Mace is a wanted killer of over 50 patriotic people. The rest is classified, a national security issue.

Gifford, Durand's late brother, had been similarly certain he was incapable of spite or vindictiveness. The house's flammable content, Freeman says, should have slowed the fire's spread. Flammable content? That's the combustible matter in a structure and its contents, multiplied by the BTUs each material emits. A pound of wood, depending on the tree species, yields 8,000-9,000 BTUs per pound - pine more than oak. Plastic produces twice as much as wood. There is also the heat release rate, measuring how rapidly a material burns in BTUs per second. The faster and hotter the fuel burns, the quicker fire spreads.","Occupying the visitor's seat, Calaphas copies Freeman's posture as a subtle insult while feigning to be a cooperative member of the group.

I know, Ella replied. His demeanor just unsettles me. The manner he looks without direct eye contact. I understand your perspective, Maud stated. However, he is pleasant. I assure you. He is simply unique. Chris had looked at Ella identically to how he looked at Louise, which was the same as he occasionally looked at Maud or Gabriel or his father. The stare had no sexual intent. But perhaps it was sufficient to be examined by a man for Ella to feel uncomfortable. As they took the shortcut through the orchard, Maud remembered visiting a public pool with her friend when she was eleven. There was one man on a plastic lounge chair who, whenever they walked by, would inspect them from head to toe with a half-smile on his face. She had felt exposed, embarrassed, felt something was amiss, although she was uncertain what. Thirty years later, she could still picture it clearly: the Coke balanced on the man's hairy stomach, his thick purple lips and hungry eyes.

Nick cranes his neck to look. Andy is still flushed, pink and rosy from what they did together. His hair is rumpled and his jawline and neck are red from rubbing against Nicks stubble. He looks gently debauched. Youre staring, Andy says. Mm-hmm. Andy rolls his eyes. Want me to stop? Nick asks. Knock yourself out, Andy says, making a sort of help yourself gesture. When they first met, Nick thought Andy was at best generically handsome, like models in the Sears catalog or ads for soap. He thought Andys looks were bland, forgettable, boring WASPy straight-nosed pale-skinned dullness. And then he started to notice the other things: the way Andys ears stick out a little, the way his smile tilts to the side, how his expression never stays the same for more than five seconds and instead acts like a television screen, displaying everything that passes through his head. None of that is in the least boring. Now when he looks at Andy, he doesnt even see his component parts unless he makes himself pay attention. Instead it all coalesces into the shape of Nicks favorite person.

Mm-hmm, Nick affirms. Want me to stop? Andy says go ahead. When they initially met, Nick saw Andy as generically good-looking in a boring, mainstream way. Over time Nick started noticing his quirks - sticky-out ears, crooked smile, ever-changing expressions - and finding them captivating. Now Andy's features blend into Nicks favorite person.

But he thinks his father just figured that out. His father is still looking at him, shocked and a little ashamed. Andy has to say something. I think itll be fun, Andy says, bringing his glass to his mouth. I have all kinds of ideas. I always thought it was, his father agrees, and raises his glass. * * * After his father goes to bed, Andy checks his watch. Somehow, despite having been awake for what feels like forty-eight hours, its not even ten oclock. He kneels in front of the television, searching for something to watch. A detective show, a police show, another detective show. No thanks. What Andy really wants to watch is the sort of sitcom that revolves around impish kids who get into minor scrapes, their well-dressed parents, and the adorable family dog. Obviously, he knows nobodys life is that perfect; obviously, he knows the reason he likes those shows so much is because theyre a glimpse into a kind of stable family life hes never known, but neither of those facts stop him from wanting to watch them.","Andrew asks his father if they can spend more time together doing activities.

15079,I_Have_Some_Questions_for_You_-_Rebecca_Makkai,"I listened to the radio a little. Then I went home, I called this girl Marissa Id been seeing, we talked from about one a.m. to two a.m. She testified to that. Later in court it becomes this whole thing, my calling her at one. They say I called her because I couldnt sleep, because I felt guilty. The next day was Saturday and I didnt have to work. We were between sports seasons, no games or meets. This is one of my only weekends off all school year, so I basically slept all day. The next day, Sunday, I see this girl Marissa, then I go to my moms for dinner, and when I get back to my place theres a squad car out front. I honestlyI grew a little weed, and its the only law Id ever broken besides running a few lights. So thats where your mind goes. Thats what I assumed was up. They want me to come back to the station in Granby, and they wont say why. What I know now is, you get a lawyer, always. But at the time, I figure that looks weird. Especially once they tell me what its about, and I realize its not the weed. Im spooked hearing about it, this girl I kind of knew. I thought she was great, and shes dead so young. Shes dead at my place of work. Thats a mindfuck. This first round of questioning, theyre chill about it, theyre like, We just want to see if you heard anything.","I listened to the radio briefly. I then went to my residence and telephoned Marissa, a woman I was dating. We conversed from roughly 1 AM to 2 AM. She would later confirm that in testimony. Subsequently in the trial, my calling her at 1 AM becomes a point of contention. They allege I telephoned her as I was unable to sleep due to feeling culpable. The next day was Saturday and I was not scheduled to work. We were in the off-season for sports, with no games or competitions. This was one of my only weekends free the entire academic year, so I largely slept the entire day. The following day, Sunday, I encountered Marissa, then attended dinner at my mother's, and upon returning to my apartment there was a patrol vehicle outside. To be forthright I cultivated a small amount of cannabis, which was the only law I had ever contravened apart from running a few traffic signals. So that was where my mind went - I assumed that was the reason for their presence. They requested I come to the station in Granby but would not disclose the reason. What I now know is that you should always retain legal counsel, however at the time I felt that would appear suspicious. Especially once they apprised me of the purpose, and I realized it did not pertain to the cannabis. I was unsettled to hear about it - this girl I was slightly acquainted with. I had thought very highly of her, and the news of her premature death at my workplace was mentally disturbing. For this initial inquiry, they were composed about it - they just wanted to ascertain if I had heard anything.","I tuned into the radio briefly. Afterward, I traveled to my house and placed a call to Marissa, a female companion I had been spending time with. We spoke approximately from 1 o'clock to 2 o'clock in the morning. She would later verify that on the witness stand. Subsequently in the trial proceedings, my ringing her at 1 turns into a major contention. They put forth that I called because sleep eluded me with guilt weighing on my conscience. The next sunrise was Saturday and I was free from occupational responsibilities. We were in an off phase for athletic activities, no matches or contests on the agenda. This counted among my only open weekends the entire academic term, so I primarily slept the hours away. Come Sunday, I saw Marissa again, then went to mother's for supper, and on my return to my flat found a squad car parked curbside. To be completely transparent I had cultivated a bit of weed, marking the only lawbreaking I had performed apart from zipping through the odd red light. So that's where my thoughts traveled - I assumed that was the impetus for their attendance. They asked I come down to the station house in Granby but would not disclose the purpose. What I know at present is that obtaining legal representation is always advisable, however at the time I felt that would seem suspicious. Especially after they apprised me of the context, and I grasped it did not involve the weed. I was thrown to get word of it all - this girl I was vaguely familiar with. I had esteemed her highly, and the news of her premature passing at my worksite was mentally destabilizing. For this initial inquest, they were composed about it all - they just aimed to discern whether I had caught wind of anything.  ","I tuned my radio briefly. Thereafter I traveled homeward and rang Marissa, a romantic interest I had been spending time with. We conversed approximately from 1 AM until 2 AM. She would later affirm said interaction under sworn testimony. Subsequently within the trial itself, my ringing her at 1 becomes a point of intense scrutiny. The prosecution asserts I contacted her as guilt precluded sleep's embrace. Dawn's rosy fingers next caressed Saturday, freeing me from occupational burden. We were within an athletic interlude, no matches or contests on the calendar. This marked a rare weekend of liberty the entire academic session, thus I whiled away most daylight hours in slumber. Sunday next I saw Marissa again ere traveling to mother's board for supper, but upon my homecoming a patrol vehicle held curbside vigil. To be forthright, I had cultivated a trifling bit of cannabis - my sole breach of law apart from the odd ignored traffic signal. Thus did my thoughts race to said transgression upon spying the coppers. They bid me attend an interview at the Granby station house but declined to elucidate their urgency. With retrospect's clarity I now know legal counsel is always advisable, but in the heat of the moment such would have seemed suspicious. Especially when apprised of the tragic context - a lass I knew in passing. I had thought highly of her, thus news of her premature passing at my workplace proved mentally destabilizing. For their initial inquest the coppers played things cool - they merely hoped to learn whether I had gleaned any knowledge of events.",A,large,0

Id found Persephone, just as Liv had, and this must be how Liv had felt, too, like she had searched the underworld for her ghost and sighted her at last. Jessi wasnt Persephone but Eurydice, and Liv was Orpheus, guiding her back toward the surface only tofoolishly, inevitablylook back as she had been forbidden to do, and now both of them were lost below.

Milo's planes, floating calmly over the blossoming tree tops with their bomb bays open and wing flaps down and massive, bug-eyed, blindingly flickering, eerily glowing landing lights on, were the most apocalyptic spectacle he had ever witnessed. The colonel let out a distressed gasp of dismay and hurled himself into his jeep, nearly sobbing. He found the gas and ignition and sped toward the airfield as fast as the rocking vehicle would go, his huge flabby hands clenched and bloodless on the wheel as he desperately honked his horn. He almost killed himself when he swerved with a banshee screech of tires to avoid crashing into a bunch of men sprinting crazily toward the hills in their underwear with their stunned faces down and thin arms pressed high around their temples as puny shields. Yellow, orange and red fires were burning on both sides of the road. Tents and trees were ablaze, and Milo's planes kept coming around ceaselessly with their blinking white landing lights on and bomb bay doors open. The colonel almost flipped the jeep when he slammed the brakes at the control tower. He leaped from the still dangerously skidding vehicle and hurtled up the flight of steps inside, where three men were busy at the instruments and controls. He bowled two of them aside in his lunge for the nickel-plated microphone, his eyes glittering wildly and beefy face contorted with stress. He squeezed the microphone in a bestial grip and began shouting hysterically at the top of his voice.",A,large,1

He was aide-de-camp to a very important personage, had been sent on a very important mission to Prussia, and had just returned from there as a special messenger. He had become thoroughly conversant with that unwritten code with which he had been so pleased at Olmutz and according to which an ensign might rank incomparably higher than a general, and according to which what was needed for success in the service was not effort or work, or courage, or perseverance, but only the knowledge of how to get on with those who can grant rewards, and he was himself often surprised at the rapidity of his success and at the inability of others to understand these things. In consequence of this discovery his whole manner of life, all his relations with old friends, all his plans for his future, were completely altered. He was not rich, but would spend his last groat to be better dressed than others, and would rather deprive himself of many pleasures than allow himself to be seen in a shabby equipage or appear in the streets of Petersburg in an old uniform. He made friends with and sought the acquaintance of only those above him in position and who could therefore be of use to him. He liked Petersburg and despised Moscow. The remembrance of the Rostovs’ house and of his childish love for Natasha was unpleasant to him and he had not once been to see the Rostovs since the day of his departure for the army.

Show evidence of a deity, you demand. I say use your telescopes to gaze at the heavens, and tell me how a god could not exist! The priest had tears in his eyes now. I ask, where did that question come from? The solutions are identical. Do you not perceive the divine in your science? How could you miss Him! You say even the slightest change in gravity's force or an atom's mass would have made our universe a lifeless haze rather than our magnificent ocean of celestial bodies, yet you fail to discern God's hand in this? Is it truly easier to believe we just picked the right card from billions? Have we become so spiritually bankrupt that we would rather believe in mathematical impossibility than in a power greater than ourselves? Whether you believe in God or not, believe this. Abandoning trust in a power beyond ourselves, we abandon accountability. Faith provides accountability to each other, ourselves, and a higher truth.",A,large,1

And Jonas remembered his friend Andrei- when they were young boys, Andrei never wanted to do physical activities. He spent all the free time he could with his building toys, and his volunteer hours were always at construction sites. The Elders were aware of that about Andrei. He was given the role of Engineer, which thrilled Andrei tremendously."" Jonas's mother added, ""Later, Andrei designed the bridge over the river west of town. I don't think you need to worry about that,"" Jonas's father reassured him. But Andrei doesn't have any serious interests. He makes everything into a game."" Jonas's father chuckled.

10149,The_Turn_of_the_Screw_-_Henry_James,"Stranger than I can express, certainly, was the effort to struggle against my new lights; it would doubtless have been, however, a greater tension still had it not been so frequently successful. I used to wonder how my little charges could help guessing that I thought strange things about them; and the circumstances that these things only made them more interesting was not by itself a direct aid to keeping them in the dark. I trembled lest they should see that they WERE so immensely more interesting. Putting things at the worst, at all events, as in meditation I so often did, any clouding of their innocence could only be-- blameless and foredoomed as they were--a reason the more for taking risks. There were moments when, by an irresistible impulse, I found myself catching them up and pressing them to my heart. As soon as I had done so I used to say to myself: ""What will they think of that? Doesn't it betray too much?"" It would have been easy to get into a sad, wild tangle about how much I might betray; but the real account, I feel, of the hours of peace that I could still enjoy was that the immediate charm of my companions was a beguilement still effective even under the shadow of the possibility that it was studied.

I feared they would see that they had become so much more interesting.

There were times when an irresistible urge made me suddenly hug them. Right after, I would think: ""What will they make of that? Doesn't it show too much?"" It would have been easy to become sad and confused about how much I might give away; but I believe the main reason I could still find peace was that the immediate appeal of my students still worked even with the possibility that I was being examined.

Even picturing the worst case, where their innocence might be clouded - impossible given their blamelessness - it would be one more reason to take risks. There were times irresistible urges made me suddenly hold them. Right after, I would consider: ""What will they think about that? Doesn't it show too much?"" It would have been simple to become sad and tangled about what I might reveal; but I believe the main reason I could still find calm was that the instant appeal of my students still worked even with the chance I was being examined. Because when I considered my stronger passion might occasionally raise doubts, I also remember wondering if I couldn't see some oddness in the clear increase of their own affection displays.",A,large,1

Standing by the window, he saw the huge flakes drifting slowly down out of an icy sky that was the colour of steel. And oh, how bitter cold it was! Everything that Charlie touched seemed to be made of ice, and each time he stepped outside the door, the wind was like a knife on his cheek. The four old ones lay silent and huddled in their bed, trying to keep the cold out of their bones. The excitement over the Golden Tickets had long since been forgotten.

But Charlie Bucket never got what he wanted because the family couldn't afford it, and as the cold weather went on and on, he became ravenously and desperately hungry. Both bars of chocolate, the birthday one and the one Grandpa Joe had bought, had long since been nibbled away, and all he got now were those thin, cabbagy meals three times a day.

10145,The_Turn_of_the_Screw_-_Henry_James,"What surpassed everything was that there was a little boy in the world who could have for the inferior age, sex, and intelligence so fine a consideration. They were extraordinarily at one, and to say that they never either quarreled or complained is to make the note of praise coarse for their quality of sweetness. Sometimes, indeed, when I dropped into coarseness, I perhaps came across traces of little understandings between them by which one of them should keep me occupied while the other slipped away. There is a naive side, I suppose, in all diplomacy; but if my pupils practiced upon me, it was surely with the minimum of grossness. It was all in the other quarter that, after a lull, the grossness broke out. I find that I really hang back; but I must take my plunge. In going on with the record of what was hideous at Bly, I not only challenge the most liberal faith--for which I little care; but--and this is another matter--I renew what I myself suffered, I again push my way through it to the end. There came suddenly an hour after which, as I look back, the affair seems to me to have been all pure suffering; but I have at least reached the heart of it, and the straightest road out is doubtless to advance. One evening--with nothing to lead up or to prepare it-- I felt the cold touch of the impression that had breathed on me the night of my arrival and which, much lighter then, as I have mentioned, I should probably have made little of in memory had my subsequent sojourn been less agitated.","What was most extraordinary was that there existed a young boy who, despite his youth and gender, had such profound care and understanding for those less capable than himself. He and I were remarkably in sync, and to say we never fought or complained understates the sweetness of our relationship. Sometimes, when I was crude, I would see signs that he and the other child were distracting me so one could sneak away. All diplomacy has some artlessness, I suppose; but if my students maneuvered around me, they did so with minimal cunning. It was later events from elsewhere that were truly awful. I hesitate to continue; but I must persist. In relaying the hideous events at Bly, I challenge even the most open mind - for which I care little; but - and this is significant - I relive my own suffering, as I push through to the end. There came an hour after which, looking back, the ordeal seems pure anguish; but I have at least reached the crux of it, and the most direct route forward is doubtless to press on. One evening - with no lead-up or warning - I felt the cold touch of the feeling that had shrouded me the night I arrived which, much fainter then, as I said, I likely would have thought little of in memory had my subsequent stay been less tumultuous.","What stood apart was a young boy existing with such thoughtful care for those not as able, despite his youth and sex. We were remarkably in tune, and to say we never disagreed or complained understates our sweet bond. Sometimes, when crude, I would see signs they kept me engaged so one could sneak off. All politics has some plainness, I expect; but if my students worked around me, it was minimally sly. The awful events came later, from elsewhere. I pause; but must keep going. In conveying Bly's horrors, I challenge even the most believing mind - which I care little for; but - significantly - I relive my pains, as I see it through. There came an hour after which, in hindsight, it seems pure agony; but I have at least reached its heart, and the clearest path is doubtlessly ahead.

10130,The_Silmarillion_-_J._R._R._Tolkien,"But no ship came ever again from the West to Nmenor, and Avalln was veiled in cloud. Now Gimilkhd died two years before his two hundredth year (which was accounted an early death for one of Elros' line even in its waning), but this brought no peace to the King. For Pharazn son of Gimilkhd had become a man yet more restless and eager for wealth and power than his father. He had fared often abroad, as a leader in the wars that the Nmenreans made then in the coastlands of Middle-earth, seeking to extend their dominion over Men; and thus he had won great renown as a captain both by land and by sea. Therefore when he came back to Nmenor, hearing of his father's death, the hearts of the people were turned to him; for he brought with him great wealth, and was for the time free in his giving. And it came to pass that Tar-Palantir grew weary of grief and died. He had no son, but a daughter only, whom he named Mriel in the Elven-tongue; and to her now by right and the laws of the Nmenreans came the sceptre. But Pharazn took her to wife against her will, doing evil in this and evil also in that the laws of Nmenor did not permit the marriage, even in the royal house, of those more nearly akin than cousins in the second degree. And when they were wedded, he seized the sceptre into his own hand, taking the title of Ar-Pharazn (Tar-Calion in the Elven-tongue); and the name of his queen he changed to Ar-Zimraphel.","However, no more ships ever came from the West to Númenor, and Avallónë was concealed by mists.

But for a select number of well-positioned, eminent clients, he wanted to create—or rather, have created—personal scents that would suit only the wearer, like tailored clothing, would be used only by the wearer, and would bear his or her illustrious name. He could envision an Aroma of the Marquise de Cernay, an Aroma of the Marchioness de Villar, an Aroma of the Duke of Aiguillon, and so on. He dreamed of an Aroma of Madame the Marquise of Pompadour, even of an Aroma of His Majesty the King, in a flask of most precious carved agate with a holder of engraved gold and, concealed inside the base, the inscribed words: ""Giuseppe Baldini, Perfumer."" The king's name and his own, both on the same object. To such glorious heights had Baldini's ideas soared! And now Grenouille had fallen ill.

Quite early on, three who tried to do so were hunted down and forced to return. Crowds of rabbits feeding at morning and evening were likely to attract attention.

The count and countess turned to her when they had any orders to give. Petya and Natasha on the contrary, far from helping their parents, were generally a nuisance and a hindrance to everyone. Almost all day long the house resounded with their running feet, their cries, and their spontaneous laughter. They laughed and were gay not because there was any reason to laugh, but because gaiety and mirth were in their hearts and so everything that happened was a cause for gaiety and laughter to them. Petya was in high spirits because having left home a boy he had returned (as everybody told him) a fine young man, because he was at home, because he had left Belaya Tserkov where there was no hope of soon taking part in a battle and had come to Moscow where there was to be fighting in a few days, and chiefly because Natasha, whose lead he always followed, was in high spirits. Natasha was gay because she had been sad too long and now nothing reminded her of the cause of her sadness, and because she was feeling well. She was also happy because she had someone to adore her: the adoration of others was a lubricant the wheels of her machine needed to make them run freelyand Petya adored her.

""One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley. Three of our boys were killed, however, before we got the swag.

She went straight to the living room and opened the drawer of the cabinet where she knew her father kept a box of cigars. She took one out and brought it to her bedroom, shutting herself inside. This will be difficult but I'm determined to do it. She now had every detail in mind almost completely, but in the end everything depended on her being able to do one very special thing with her eyesight. She knew she wouldn't be able to do it right away, but she felt fairly sure that with a lot of practice and hard work, she would succeed eventually. The cigar was essential. It was maybe a little thicker than she would have preferred, but the weight was about right. It would be fine for practicing with. She moved these things aside and placed the cigar in the middle of the dressing table. Then she walked away and sat on the end of her bed. She was now about ten feet from the cigar. It had been lovely doing it. It had felt like sparks were swirling around and flashing out of her eyes. It had given her an almost ethereal sense of power. And how fast it had been this time!

Hellohello, they say, always twice with two head nods, then continue on their way. The man sometimes has a boa constrictor wrapped around his neck, though the snake is never acknowledged, by me or him.

This fellow is madly, insanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a registry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark that point. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them.","This man has fallen head over heels in love with a woman, but two years prior, before he truly knew her since she was away at boarding school, he foolishly married a barmaid he barely knew in Bristol in a civil ceremony. No one knows this fact that causes him such anguish, as he longs to propose to the woman he actually loves but knows he cannot due to already having a wife. It was this intense frustration that made him react so strongly when his father pressed him to propose to Ms. Turner during their last conversation. Additionally, he had no financial means to support himself and his father, reportedly a strict man, would have abandoned him if he knew the truth. He spent the last three days with his barmaid wife in Bristol, unbeknownst to his father. This last point is significant. Some good has come from this situation, however, as the barmaid learned from the media that he is in serious legal trouble and likely to be executed, so she has broken all ties, informing him that she already has a husband stationed at the Bermuda Naval Yard. Therefore, there is no real relationship left between them.","This fellow has fallen passionately in love with a woman, but two years prior, when he was a young lad and before he truly was acquainted with her since she was studying at a boarding school, the fool marries a Bristol barmaid at a civil court office whom he barely knew. Nobody is aware of this reality that causes him such torment, as he longs to ask the hand of the lady he genuinely loves but realizes he cannot due to his existing marriage. It was this intense aggravation that made him respond so strongly when his father insisted he propose to Ms. Turner in their last discussion. Furthermore, he had no means to provide for himself and his father, allegedly a strict man, would have disowned him if he discovered the truth. He was with his barmaid wife for the last three days in Bristol, without his father's knowledge. This final point is of consequence. Some good has emerged from this circumstance, nonetheless, as the barmaid learned from media reports that he is in grave legal jeopardy and likely to be executed, so she has severed all ties, telling him that she already has a husband based at the Bermuda Shipyard, therefore, no genuine relationship persists between them.

7763,Fear_of_Flying_-_Erica_Jong,"I had lost weight during our strange journey but I was still rather too fat for fashion; not obese but just about ten pounds too plump to get away with a bikini. Medium-sized breasts, big ass, deep navel. Some men claimed to like my figure. I knew (in the way one knows things one does not quite believe) that I was considered pretty and that even my big ass was considered attractive by some, but I loathed every extra ounce of fat. It had been a lifelong struggle: gaining weight, losing it, gaining it back with interest. Every extra ounce was proof of my own weakness and sloth and self-indulgence. Every extra ounce proved how right I was to loathe myself, how vile and disgusting I was. Excess flesh was connected with sex—that much I knew. At fourteen, when I had starved myself down to ninety-eight pounds, it was out of guilt about sex. Even after I had lost all the weight I wanted to lose—and  more —I would deny myself water. I wanted to feel  empty.  Unless the hunger pangs boomed resoundingly, I hated myself for my indulgence. Clearly a pregnancy fantasy—as my husband the shrink would say—or maybe pregnancy phobia. My unconscious believed that my jerking off Steve had made me pregnant and I was getting thinner and thinner to try to convince myself it wasn’t so. Or else maybe I  longed  to be pregnant, primitively believed that all the orifices of the body were one, and feared that any food I took would seed my intestines like sperm, and fruit would grow from me.

But that doesn’t mean that all human beings are alike. Those who live near the equator have darker skins than people in the more northerly climes because their dark skin protects them from the sun. White people who expose themselves to the sun for long periods are more prone to skin cancer.”    “Is it a similar advantage to have white skin if you live in northern countries?”    “Yes, otherwise everyone on earth would be dark-skinned.

When Mrs. Turner’s brother came and she brought him over to be introduced, Tea Cake had a brainstorm. Before the week was over he had whipped Janie.

9819,The_Mysteries_of_Udolpho_-_Ann_Radcliffe,"As they descended, they saw at a distance, on the right, one of the grand passes of the Pyrenees into Spain, gleaming with its battlements and towers to the splendour of the setting rays, yellow tops of woods colouring the steeps below, while far above aspired the snowy points of the mountains, still reflecting a rosy hue. St. Aubert began to look out for the little town he had been directed to by the people of Beaujeu, and where he meant to pass the night; but no habitation yet appeared. Of its distance Valancourt could not assist him to judge, for he had never been so far along this chain of Alps before. There was, however, a road to guide them; and there could be little doubt that it was the right one; for, since they had left Beaujeu, there had been no variety of tracks to perplex or mislead. The sun now gave his last light, and St. Aubert bade the muleteer proceed with all possible dispatch. He found, indeed, the lassitude of illness return upon him, after a day of uncommon fatigue, both of body and mind, and he longed for repose. His anxiety was not soothed by observing a numerous train, consisting of men, horses, and loaded mules, winding down the steeps of an opposite mountain, appearing and disappearing at intervals among the woods, so that its numbers could not be judged of. Something bright, like arms, glanced in the setting ray, and the military dress was distinguishable upon the men who were in the van, and on others scattered among the troop that followed.","As the group went down the mountain, they noticed far away to their right one of the big mountain passes from France into Spain. Its towers and walls shone in the fading sunlight. The yellow treetops lower down the slopes contrasted with the snow-covered peaks high above, which still glowed pink. St. Aubert looked for the small town where he planned to spend the night, as directed by the people of Beaujeu, but no buildings were yet visible. Valancourt could not help judge the distance, since he had not traveled this part of the Pyrenees before. But there was a road to guide them, leaving little doubt it was the correct one. With the sun's last rays departing, St. Aubert told the mule driver to hurry. He felt his sickness returning after the long tiring day, both physically and mentally, and he yearned to rest. His worry was not calmed by observing a large parade of men, horses, and loaded mules snaking down the slope of a facing mountain, appearing and vanishing among the woods, so he could not guess its size. Weapons glinted in the fading light, and military uniforms were visible on the men in front and others dispersed through the troop.","As they went lower down the mountainside, they glimpsed off at a distance to the right one of the huge Pyrenees crossings into Spain, its fortifications and spires shining in the setting sunlight. The yellow treetops coloring the slopes below contrasted with the snow-covered peaks high above, still emanating a pinkish hue. St. Aubert searched for the small village where he intended staying the night as guided by the Beaujeu townspeople, but no buildings were yet evident. Valancourt could not assist in gauging the distance, since he had never traversed this portion of the Pyrenees previously. However, a road existed to direct them, leaving scarcely any uncertainty it was the accurate one. With the sun emitting its final rays, St. Aubert instructed the mule handler to proceed with utmost haste. He sensed the fatigue of illness returning after the unusually tiring day, both bodily and mentally, and he yearned for rest. His fretfulness was not pacified by spotting a huge parade of men, horses, and burdened mules winding down the steep of a facing mountain, materializing and fading among the woods, rendering its magnitude impossible to estimate.

Being careful not to wake Johnny up, I went to sit on the stairs and smoke a cigarette. The dawn was arriving then. The whole lower valley was covered with mist, and sometimes little pieces of it broke off and floated away in small clouds. The sky was lighter in the east, and the horizon was a thin golden line. The clouds shifted from gray to pink, and the mist was touched with gold. There was a silent moment when everything held its breath, and then the sun rose. It was beautiful.",A,large,1
9043,Tess_of_the_d'Urbervilles_-_Thomas_Hardy,"Between the post were ranged the milchers, each exhibiting herself at the present moment to a whimsical eye in the rear as a circle on two stalks, down the centre of which a switch moved pendulum-wise; while the sun, lowering itself behind this patient row, threw their shadows accurately inwards upon the wall. Thus it threw shadows of these obscure and homely figures every evening with as much care over each contour as if it had been the profile of a court beauty on a palace wall; copied them as diligently as it had copied Olympian shapes on marble FACADES long ago, or the outline of Alexander, Caesar, and the Pharaohs. They were the less restful cows that were stalled. Those that would stand still of their own will were milked in the middle of the yard, where many of such better behaved ones stood waiting now--all prime milchers, such as were seldom seen out of this valley, and not always within it; nourished by the succulent feed which the water-meads supplied at this prime season of the year. Those of them that were spotted with white reflected the sunshine in dazzling brilliancy, and the polished brass knobs of their horns glittered with something of military display. Their large-veined udders hung ponderous as sandbags, the teats sticking out like the legs of a gipsy's crock; and as each animal lingered for her turn to arrive the milk oozed forth and fell in drops to the ground.","The cows were lined up between the posts, each one curved in the back like a circle on two legs, with a switch moving back and forth down the middle. The lowering sun cast their shadows accurately inwards on the wall behind them. It copied the outlines of these plain, ordinary creatures every night with as much care as if they were beautiful court ladies on a palace wall long ago. The more restless cows were the ones kept in stalls. The better behaved ones that would stand still were milked in the yard, where many prime specimens waited now - all top milk producers rarely seen outside this valley. Their large, heavy udders hung like sandbags, with teats sticking out like the legs of a gypsy's pot, and milk dripped from them as they waited their turn.","The cows stood between the posts, curved backs making them look like circles on two feet, tails swishing side to side. The setting sun threw their silhouettes precisely onto the wall, tracing their shapes as meticulously as if they were aristocratic beauties in a painting. The cows in stalls were less calm. Superior milkers that would stand on their own were milked mid-yard, where many such finest breeds now waited - premium milk producers seldom seen beyond the valley. Bulging udders sagged like sacks, teats jutting out like a gypsy pot's legs. Milk leaked out and fell as they lingered for their turn.  ","The bovines formed a line between the poles, each one arched in spine like a ring on two pillars, with a switch flicking from end to end along the axis. The descending sunlight projected their outlines accurately inward on the barrier behind them. It replicated the curves of these modest, mundane beasts every evening with as much attention as if they were highborn ladies in an artwork of old. The more troubled cows were kept in pens. Those obedient enough to stand unaided were drained amid the enclosure, where numerous such superior yielders presently abided - rarely glimpsed outwith these fields, seldom even among them. Their capacious bags hung heavy as pouches, nipples sticking forth like the pegs of a wanderer's pot, and lactate emerged in beads to the ground as they bided their opportunity.",A,large,1

It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an Anti-Cheating spell. They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox -- points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion. Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn't sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it. Maybe it was because they hadn't seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn't have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn't seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn't keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn't have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to.","The days slowly passed by, and there was no doubt Fluffy continued living behind the locked door.

But whether Mr Clare had spoken seriously or not, why should she, who could never conscientiously allow any man to marry her now, and who had religiously determined that she never would be tempted to do so, draw off Mr Clare's attention from other women, for the brief happiness of sunning herself in his eyes while he remained at Talbothays? XXII They came downstairs yawning next morning; but skimming and milking were proceeded with as usual, and they went indoors to breakfast. Dairyman Crick was discovered stamping about the house. He had received a letter, in which a customer had complained that the butter had a twang. ""And begad, so 't have!"" said the dairyman, who held in his left hand a wooden slice on which a lump of butter was stuck. ""Yes--taste for yourself!"" Several of them gathered round him; and Mr Clare tasted, Tess tasted, also the other indoor milkmaids, one or two of the milking-men, and last of all Mrs Crick, who came out from the waiting breakfast-table. There certainly was a twang.","Such imbalanced relationships had resulted in matrimony; and she had heard from Mrs. Crick that Mr. Clare had once jokingly inquired what would be the purpose of his marrying a refined lady, while he had ten thousand acres of colonial pasture to provide for, cattle to raise, and grain to harvest. A farm woman would be the only reasonable kind of wife for him. But whether Mr. Clare had spoken genuinely or not, why should she, who could never conscientiously permit any man to marry her now, and who had devoutly determined that she never would be tempted to do so, distract Mr. Clare's attention from other women, for the brief joy of basking in his gaze while he stayed at Talbothays? ","These uneven bonds had brought about marriage; and she had been told by Mrs. Crick that Mr. Clare had once casually questioned what would be the benefit of his wedding a genteel woman, while he had ten thousand acres of overseas pasture to supply, livestock to breed, and corn to gather. A woman of the farm would be the only logical kind of spouse for him. But whether Mr. Clare had uttered seriously or not, why should she, who could never in good conscience let any man wed her now, and who had piously decided that she never would be allured to do so, draw Mr. Clare's notice from other ladies, for the short-lived happiness of enjoying his admiration while he lingered at Talbothays?","Such lopsided ties had resulted in matrimony; and she had caught wind from Mrs. Crick that Mr. Clare had once jokingly pondered what would be the purpose of his marrying a highborn lady, while he had ten thousand acres of foreign pasture to provide for, beasts to raise, and grain to reap. A woman of the farm would be the only reasonable kind of bride for him. But whether Mr. Clare had spoken genuinely or not, why should she, who could never in good faith permit any man to take her hand in marriage now, and who had devoutly determined that she never would be enticed to do so, distract Mr. Clare's attention from other damsels, for the fleeting joy of reveling in his admiration while he stayed at Talbothays?",A,large,1

D'you mean to say--?"" ""Not a word of it,"" said Marvel, stoutly. The mariner stared, paper in hand. Mr. Marvel jerkily faced about. ""Wait a bit,"" said the mariner, rising and speaking slowly. ""D'you mean to say--?"" ""I do,"" said Mr. Marvel. ""Then why did you let me go on and tell you all this blarsted stuff, then? What d'yer mean by letting a man make a fool of himself like that for? Eigh?"" Mr. Marvel blew out his cheeks.","Marvel insisted there was no Invisible Man at all, even though the mariner held a newspaper article claiming otherwise. Marvel accused the mariner of letting him ramble on with his story when it was all a hoax. ","Marvel dismissed the newspaper story as a total fabrication, saying he knew who started the bogus rumor about an Invisible Man. The mariner was perplexed, asking Marvel why he let him go on about it if none of it was true. Marvel accused the mariner of letting him make a fool of himself.","Marvel rejected the newspaper account as false, asserting there was no such thing as an Invisible Man. He said he was familiar with the person who began the lie. The mariner, holding the newspaper, was dumbfounded. He asked Marvel why he allowed him to continue with his account if it was all untrue. Marvel said the mariner let him babble on like an idiot with his made-up tale.",A,medium,1
8847,Perfume_The_Story_of_a_Murderer_-_Patrick_Suskind,"But his hand automatically kept on making the dainty motion, practiced a thousand times over, of dunking the handkerchief, shaking it out, and whisking it rapidly past his face, and with each whisk he automatically snapped up a portion of scent-drenched air, only to let it out again with the proper exhalations and pauses. Until finally his own nose  liberated him from the torture, swelling in allergic reaction till it was stopped up as tight as if plugged with wax. He could not smell a thing now, could hardly breathe. It was as if a bad cold had soldered his nose shut; little tears gathered in the corners of his eyes. Thank God in heaven! Now he could quit in good conscience. He had done his duty, to the best of his abilities, according to all the rules of the art, and was, as so often before, defeated.  Ultra posse nemo obligatur . Closing time. Tomorrow morning he would send off to Pélissier’s for a large bottle of Amor and Psyche and use it to scent the Spanish hide for Count Verhamont, as per order. And after that he would take his valise, full of old-fashioned soaps, scent bags, pomades, and sachets and make his rounds among the salons of doddering countesses. And one day the last doddering countess would be dead, and with her his last customer. By then he would himself be doddering and would have to sell his business, to Pélissier or another one of these upstart merchants—perhaps he would get a few thousand livres for it. And he would pack one or two bags and go off to Italy with his old wife, if she was not dead herself by then. And if he survived the trip, he would buy a little house in the country near Messina where things were cheap. And there in bitterest poverty he, Giuseppe Baldini, once the greatest perfumer of Paris, would die—whenever God willed it. And that was well and good. ","However, his hand kept automatically making the well-practiced, dainty motion of dipping the handkerchief, shaking it out, and swiftly whisking it past his face. With each whisk, he reflexively inhaled a portion of the scent-soaked air, only to exhale again with the proper pauses and breaths. Finally, his own nose freed him from the agony, swelling in an allergic response until it was as blocked up as if plugged with wax. He could not smell anything now, could hardly breathe.
