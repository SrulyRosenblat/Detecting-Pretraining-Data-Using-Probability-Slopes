# Perplexity Slope Method
***Created as part of the AI Disclosures Project at the Social Science Research Council***

## Introduction

The **Perplexity Slope Method** is a novel approach for recognizing when text generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) is included in its training data. The theory is based on the observation that an LLM becomes more confident in its predictions as it processes text it has seen before. By isolating this increase in confidence, we aim to detect when a model recognizes familiar text.

## Theoretical Background

When an LLM encounters a sequence it has seen in its training data, its "confidence" or internal probability of predicting the next token should tend to rise as more of the sequence is processed. By analyzing the slope of this increasing confidence, we hypothesize that it is possible to detect when the model is recognizing text it has been trained on.

## Methodology

The core of our method is measuring the change in probabilities (or sureness) as the model generates text. However, simply analyzing the probabilities is insufficient, as some tokens are easier to predict regardless of context (e.g., punctuation or common words). To account for this, we employ various normalization techniques. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of our method:

### 1. Fitting a Line to Token Probabilities

To quantify the rise in token prediction confidence over time, we use **Linear Regression** (via `sklearn`'s `LinearRegression` model) to fit a line through the predicted probabilities of each token in the sequence. The coefficient (slope) of this line serves as our main metric, representing the increase in confidence.

### 2. Normalization of Probabilities

Some tokens are inherently easier to predict (e.g., periods at the end of sentences). To mitigate the effect of such tokens on the overall slope, we employ several normalization strategies.

#### 2.1 N-gram Normalization

We introduce an **N-gram Normalization** technique to remove the influence of particularly predictable tokens. Specifically, for a given token *t*, we subtract the probability of *t* given *n* preceding tokens from the probability of *t* given all preceding tokens. This allows us to adjust for how much of the token's predictability comes from general sentence structure rather than specific sequence context.

#### 2.2 Mean and Z-Score Normalization

Another method involves normalizing the slope by applying the **mean** and **z-score** to the token probabilities. After calculating the slope using either raw probabilities or N-gram adjusted probabilities, we compute the mean and standard deviation of the same probabilities. These statistics are then used to normalize the slope, accounting for outliers or irregularities in the data.

### 3. Measuring and Analyzing the Slope

Once the normalization is applied, the slope of the line fitted to the sequence's probabilities provides a measure of increasing confidence. If the slope more positive and steeper than for unknown sequences, it can be an indicator that the model has seen the text before.

## Datasets

We ran tests on the model on the folowing datasets:

ArXivTection:

BookTection:

WikiMia:

Internal Oreily Dataset:

## Preliminary Results
*all results tested on the mamba 1.4b*

In our early results, and when comparing our findings to the current state-of-the-art membership inference attack MinK++, we found in our preliminary research that our method performs better on some datasets while underperforming on others. This suggests that membership inference attacks may be more dataset-specific than previously thought, and that a ensemble approach using 2 or more methods may be warranted.

Specifically, we found that on the BookTection dataset, we outperformed MinK++ by a wide margin, even when limiting ourselves to just the 1-gram mean-adjusted case. We also observed a smaller but still significant improvement with our custom O'Reilly dataset. On the other hand, in the WikiMia 128-word subset and ArxivTection dataset, MinK++ significantly outperformed our approach.

The reasons behind the wide disparity in results may be due to how frequently the tokens in the dataset change and how rare the tokens are overall. For example, the WikiMia dataset contains text from Wikipedia, which is suspected to be included in the training data of most LLMs trained after 2022. However, we do not know how many versions of that text appeared in the model’s dataset, given how frequently Wikipedia is edited. This means that our method may have a harder time detecting the slope due to there being more variations of "correct" answers. There may also be other major differences between the datasets, such as the citation style in the Arxiv dataset. More research is needed to understand why both methods’ performance varies so greatly.
